# Hello Devers!
**This repo is a skeleton app to book appointments with people**

It is focused on using JavaScript Objects precisely Getters and Setters.

Visit [my dev.to page](https://dev.to/elijahtrillionz/building-a-project-with-javascript-objects-1dn) to get the full details of this project.

**Feel free to use this code and build a wonderful appointment booking app.**

#### What should you expect from me soon
- I have made a library app using JavaScript Classes only, so I intend to publish a blog post on that.
- I have currently completed an API for JavaScript Quiz and Challenges. I will be publishing the link soon. So if you have any questions (JavaScript, HTML, CSS) you would love to add to it do that on [this repo](https://github.com/Elijah-trillionz/Quiz-api). And if you have tasks (JavaScript) that you would love to add to the challenge. Please do so [on this repo](https://github.com/Elijah-trillionz/Exercise-API)
- The project I intend using that API for is 90% ready.
